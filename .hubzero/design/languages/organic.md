# Organic

Organic design communicates warmth, humanity, and approachability.

Interfaces should feel natural, welcoming, and comfortable rather than mechanical.

Trust should emerge through empathy and simplicity.

---

# Decision Hierarchy

When two subsystems conflict, resolve in this order:

1. **Comfort** — nothing may make the interface feel urgent or pressured.
2. **Corner and form** — soft geometry is the most visible commitment.
3. **Colour** — natural, warm, low-saturation.
4. **Spacing** — generous and relaxed in rhythm.
5. **Photography** — natural light and real material.
6. **Motion** — unhurried, never snapping.
7. **Typography** — comfortable to read at length.

Where efficiency and ease conflict, Organic chooses ease. A denser layout that would let a visitor accomplish something faster is the wrong answer here, which is precisely what separates Organic from Industrial and Technical.

# Signature Traits

- Human-centered
- Calm
- Natural rhythm
- Gentle interactions
- Authentic communication

---

# Typography Language

Typography should feel approachable, warm, and easy to read rather than engineered for maximum efficiency. Rounded or humanist type families support the language's comfort-first personality more naturally than geometric or highly technical faces.

Hierarchy should support a relaxed reading pace — generous line height and moderate contrast between scale steps — rather than the tight, high-density hierarchy of a technical interface.

---

# Colour Language

Colors should feel inspired by nature and real-world materials.

Avoid overly saturated or artificial palettes.

---

# Motion Language

Motion should feel gentle, supportive, and unhurried — closer to how a person moves than how a machine operates. Easing should be soft and organic, gradually accelerating and decelerating rather than snapping to position.

Transitions should never distract from content or feel urgent; if a motion effect creates any sense of pressure or speed, it works against Organic's core promise of comfort.

---

# Photography Language

Photography must show authentic people, natural environments, and real experiences — this is the single most important expression of the language, because manufactured stock photography immediately breaks the sense of warmth and trust Organic depends on.

Lighting should feel natural rather than studio-perfect; a small amount of imperfection reads as more human than a flawlessly retouched image. Avoid generic stock photography, staged smiles, and artificial-feeling environments at all costs — they are the fastest way to undermine an Organic blueprint.

---

# Corner Language

Corners should be soft and generously rounded across nearly every component, echoing natural forms rather than mechanical ones. Rounding should feel comfortable, not decorative — closer to a smooth stone or a soft cushion than a stylistic flourish.

Sharp, hard corners should be rare exceptions rather than a baseline treatment; when they appear at all, they should be reserved for elements that genuinely need to feel structural.

---

# Border Language

Borders are used sparingly and, when present, should be soft rather than crisp — a low-contrast line rather than a hard rule. Organic interfaces prefer to separate content through spacing, soft background shifts, and gentle shadow rather than visible lines, since a border can read as a barrier and Organic is built around approachability.

Where a border is genuinely needed, keep its color close to the background so it recedes rather than draws a boundary.

---

# Shadow Language

Shadow should be soft, warm, and diffuse — never sharp or high-contrast. A gentle, low-opacity shadow beneath a card or button suggests it is resting naturally rather than mechanically elevated, similar to the soft shadow a real object casts in ambient light.

Avoid crisp, dark, or geometric shadows entirely; they introduce a technical harshness that works against the comfort Organic is built to communicate.

---

# Spacing Language

Generous spacing creates the sense of calm and room to breathe that Organic depends on. Spacing should feel natural and slightly relaxed in rhythm rather than rigidly systematized — closer to how elements are arranged in a comfortable physical space than to a strict technical grid.

Crowded layouts are one of the fastest ways to undermine an Organic blueprint's promise of ease.

---

# Interaction Language

Hover, focus, and active states should feel gentle and responsive rather than sharp or immediate — a soft scale change, a warm color shift, a slow fade rather than an instant snap. Feedback should feel encouraging rather than corrective; even error states should be communicated with warmth rather than alarm.

Interactions should invite exploration without ever feeling demanding or urgent.

---

# Component Language

Components should invite interaction without demanding attention — soft-edged buttons, generously rounded cards, and comfortable proportions throughout. Comfort should always take precedence over visual novelty; a component that looks clever but feels cold does not belong in an Organic interface.

Every recurring component should feel like it was designed to be touched, not just looked at.

---

# Visual Rhythm

A page should unfold at an unhurried, natural pace, with generous breathing room between sections rather than a dense, efficient stack of content. The same soft corners, gentle shadow, and warm imagery should recur consistently from section to section, so the page feels like a single comfortable environment rather than a sequence of disconnected blocks.

Visual rhythm in Organic design should feel like a walk through a welcoming space, not a scroll through a feed.

---

# Responsive Behavior

Organic's promise is ease, and a crowded mobile layout breaks that promise faster than any other failure available to it.

Protect spacing above all else. When something must give at handheld width, reduce the number of elements on screen rather than the room between them. A dense Organic layout is a contradiction; a sparse one that requires more scrolling is not.

Corner radius should scale with element size rather than staying fixed. A radius that reads as softly rounded on a wide card can read as nearly square on a narrow one, quietly removing the language's most identifying trait exactly where most visitors will see it.

Photography benefits from taller, more immersive crops on mobile — natural light and material texture read better in a portrait frame than in a letterboxed desktop crop scaled down.

Reading measure matters more here than in most languages, because Organic layouts tend toward longer prose. Verify line length at handheld width specifically rather than assuming the desktop measure scales.

Motion stays unhurried. Shortening durations to feel snappier on mobile contradicts the Motion Language; if motion feels slow on a phone, reduce how much of it there is rather than how long it takes.

---

# Token Contract

Organic must own the following rather than inherit them.

* **Radius** — generously rounded across the scale, and larger at the upper end than a general-purpose default provides. This is the language's most identifying value; inheriting a moderate default produces something closer to Modern.
* **Colour** — a warm, natural, low-saturation palette. An inherited cool neutral scale contradicts the language completely while looking perfectly acceptable in isolation.
* **Spacing scale** — more generous than a neutral default.
* **Motion easing** — soft curves that accelerate and decelerate gradually. A standard easing curve is usually too abrupt at both ends.
* **Shadow** — soft and diffuse where present, suggesting natural light rather than elevation.

Warm and desaturated palettes sit closest to the accessibility threshold. Verify every foreground value against every surface it appears on — cream and parchment grounds especially — per the Contrast Contract in `.hubzero/design/principles.md`. A muted tone that reads as obviously legible in isolation is exactly the case that fails measurement.
