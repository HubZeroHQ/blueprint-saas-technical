# Brutalist

Brutalist design communicates confidence through simplicity, boldness, and unapologetic structure.

It embraces honesty over polish and clarity over refinement.

Every element should feel direct and intentional.

# Decision Hierarchy

When two subsystems conflict, resolve in this order:

1. **Structural honesty** — the interface must not disguise what it is.
2. **Typography** — scale and weight carry the page.
3. **Border and corner** — structure is drawn, not implied.
4. **Spacing** — tight and grid-derived.
5. **Colour** — flat, minimal, functional.
6. **Motion** — last, and usually absent.

If a decision would make the interface more comfortable at the cost of being less honest about its structure, Brutalist chooses honesty. This is the inverse of every restraint-led language, which would resolve the same conflict toward comfort.

# Signature Traits

- Honesty over decoration
- Bold typography
- Strong visual hierarchy
- High contrast
- Functional confidence

---

# Colour Language

Color should support hierarchy through contrast.

Avoid decorative palettes.

---

# Typography Language

Typography is the loudest element on the page and should behave that way. Headlines run large — often uncomfortably large — set in heavy or black weights that leave no doubt about hierarchy. Body copy should be plain and highly legible, with little tonal variation between weights: Brutalist typography draws its power from scale and contrast, not from a refined type system with many intermediate steps. Avoid italics, light weights, and decorative type treatments entirely; they soften a language that is meant to feel blunt.

---

# Motion Language

Motion should barely exist. Where it appears, it should be instantaneous — a state change that snaps into place rather than eases into it. Avoid fades, slides, parallax, or any easing curve that implies gentleness; a hard cut or an immediate opacity swap communicates more honestly than a 300ms transition ever could. If a motion effect would feel at home in a luxury or editorial interface, it does not belong here.

---

# Photography Language

Photography should be unretouched and unstaged — real people, real environments, real work, shot in a way that refuses to flatter. Avoid glossy lighting, color grading, or the soft, aspirational treatment common to marketing photography; a slightly harsh or documentary quality is correct. Images should be presented at full size or cropped aggressively into the grid rather than floated in decorative frames — imagery is content, not ornament. See `.hubzero/experience/photography.md` for how this translates into image generation.

---

# Corner Language

Corners are sharp everywhere, without exception. Every button, card, input, and container uses a hard 90-degree corner; rounding of any radius — even a single pixel — reads as a concession to softness that Brutalist design does not make. This uniformity is part of the honesty: nothing is smoothed over to look more approachable than it is.

---

# Border Language

Borders are heavy, visible, and used deliberately to expose structure rather than to decorate it. A full, high-contrast border around a card or section is a normal, expected treatment — not something to be minimized in favor of whitespace. Border weight should be thick enough to read at a glance; a hairline border undermines the confrontational directness Brutalist design is built on.

---

# Shadow Language

Shadow does not exist in this language. Elevation and separation are communicated entirely through borders, contrast, and position — never through drop shadows, glows, or soft gradients suggesting depth. A Brutalist interface is flat by conviction: introducing shadow to fake dimensionality would contradict the honesty the language is built around.

---

# Spacing Language

Spacing is structural, not decorative. Use a visible, consistent grid with tight, functional gaps rather than generous breathing room — whitespace in Brutalist design should never be used to create an impression of luxury or calm. Alignment should be obvious and slightly rigid; if the underlying grid isn't visible in the finished layout, add more structure, not more space.

---

# Interaction Language

Hover and active states should be blunt and immediate — a hard color inversion, a solid background swap, or a visible outline appearing instantly, with no easing. Focus states should be equally stark: a thick outline or filled indicator rather than a subtle glow. Every interactive element should look interactive at rest — Brutalist design does not rely on hover to reveal what can be clicked.

---

# Component Language

Every component should announce its function on sight. Buttons look like buttons — solid fills, hard corners, heavy borders — not subtle text links or ghost states that require a second look. Cards are simple rectangles delineated by border weight and contrast, not by shadow or rounding. If a component needs an explanation of what it does, it has failed the Brutalist standard.

---

# Visual Rhythm

A Brutalist page reads as a sequence of blunt, high-contrast blocks rather than a smooth gradient of visual intensity. Sections should feel stacked and modular, each one clearly bounded by its border and grid position, so the page has the rhythm of a stack of printed sheets rather than a continuous flow. Consistency comes from repeating the same sharp, undecorated vocabulary — type, border, grid — at every scale, not from varying intensity for effect.

---

# Responsive Behavior

Brutalist recomposes more honestly than most languages, because it has no decorative layer to lose.

At handheld width the grid becomes single-column and its structure becomes *more* visible, not less — rules and borders that separated columns on desktop become the separators between stacked blocks. Type scale stays aggressive; a display heading that dominated the desktop viewport should still dominate the phone. Reducing it to a comfortable size is the most common way a Brutalist blueprint quietly becomes a generic one on mobile.

Navigation is a full-screen inversion rather than a floating drawer — a hard state change, consistent with the language's refusal to layer soft surfaces over content.

Touch targets meet accessibility minimums through padding, never through added corner radius.

---

# Token Contract

Brutalist must own the following rather than inherit them. Any of these left at a shared default is a failure to adopt the language.

* **Radius** — every radius token is `0`. This is the language's single most identifying value, and inheriting a rounded default contradicts the Corner Language outright.
* **Motion duration and easing** — instant or near-instant, with linear or stepped easing. An inherited eased curve implies a gentleness this language rejects.
* **Shadow** — no elevation tokens. Depth is expressed by border and colour, never by shadow.
* **Border width** — heavier than a typical hairline, and defined explicitly, since borders carry the structural work here.

Because Brutalist zeroes several shared tokens, collapse the token itself rather than overriding it per component. A single categorical value at the design-language layer is what keeps every component consistent without any of them knowing about the rule.

# Anti-Patterns

Avoid unnecessary polish, soft aesthetics, decorative gradients, or excessive animation.
