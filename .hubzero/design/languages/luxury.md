# Luxury Design Language

Luxury is a design language built around exclusivity, craftsmanship, and refinement.

Luxury does not seek attention.

It assumes attention has already been earned.

Rather than overwhelming visitors with decoration, Luxury communicates confidence through exceptional execution, thoughtful composition, premium materials, and meticulous attention to detail.

Every interaction should feel considered.

# Decision Hierarchy

When two subsystems conflict, resolve in this order:

1. **Restraint** — the option that asks for less attention wins.
2. **Typography** — proportion and refinement carry the identity.
3. **Spacing** — space itself communicates value.
4. **Photography** — imagery is the primary material.
5. **Colour** — narrow, confident, accents rare.
6. **Corner and border** — minimal, precise.
7. **Motion and shadow** — near-absent.

Luxury resolves toward removal and distance. Where a treatment would make the experience more immediately engaging at the cost of composure, Luxury declines it — confidence is expressed by not needing to persuade.

**Against Premium:** Premium *demonstrates* care through visible detail and satisfying feedback. Luxury *withholds*, creating value through space and absence. Faced with the same optional refinement, Premium adds it and Luxury removes it. A Luxury blueprint accumulating small delightful details has drifted into Premium.

# Design Objective

Create experiences that feel premium, timeless, and carefully crafted.

Luxury should elevate perception through quality rather than excess.

The interface should leave visitors with the impression that nothing has been overlooked.

---

# Signature Traits

A Luxury blueprint should communicate:

* Exclusivity
* Sophistication
* Confidence
* Craftsmanship
* Timelessness

Every visual decision should reinforce these qualities.

---

# Visual Direction

Luxury interfaces value proportion, balance, and refinement above decoration.

Visual hierarchy should feel natural rather than forceful.

Premium experiences rarely compete for attention.

Instead, they invite exploration through confidence and composure.

---

# Typography Language

Typography should express character and refinement rather than novelty. Hierarchy emerges through scale, spacing, rhythm, and proportion — a refined serif or sans used with unusual confidence, given more room to breathe than convention suggests.

Display typography should feel intentional rather than ornamental: a single considered display treatment paired with a quiet, highly legible text face communicates more luxury than a system with many competing voices. Readability should never be sacrificed for style — an interface that is beautiful but effortful to read undermines the confidence Luxury depends on.

---

# Colour Language

Color should communicate restraint.

A carefully selected palette often feels more luxurious than one with excessive variety.

Contrast should guide attention with confidence.

Accent colors should be introduced deliberately and sparingly.

---

# Motion Language

Motion should feel smooth, unhurried, and deliberate — closer to the way a well-made mechanism moves than the way software animates. Transitions should enhance perceived quality rather than showcase animation technique; the goal is precision, not spectacle.

Easing should be gentle and symmetrical, with no bounce, overshoot, or elastic effects — those read as playful rather than considered. Every animation should have a purpose: revealing content, confirming an action, guiding attention. Motion that exists only to be noticed does not belong in a Luxury blueprint.

---

# Photography Language

Photography should communicate atmosphere and craftsmanship — material, light, and texture rendered with the same care a luxury brand would apply to a print campaign. Images should feel intentional rather than decorative filler: a close, considered crop on a material detail often communicates more quality than a wide establishing shot.

Lighting should be controlled and refined rather than bright and generic. Every image must contribute to the perception of excellence; if an image could be removed without loss, it should be removed. See `.hubzero/experience/photography.md` for how this translates into image generation.

---

# Corner Language

Corners should be treated with the same restraint as everything else in a Luxury interface — either sharp or barely rounded, applied with total consistency across every surface.

A slight, uniform radius can soften an interface without undermining its seriousness; a large, friendly radius reads as approachable in a way that contradicts Luxury's composure. Never mix corner treatments across components — a mix reads as assembled rather than designed.

---

# Border Language

Borders are used with extreme restraint. A Luxury interface earns separation through space, contrast, and material quality rather than lines drawn around things.

Where a border is unavoidable — a subtle frame around an image, a hairline beneath a navigation bar — it should be thin, low-contrast, and nearly imperceptible until looked for. Heavy or decorative borders read as cheap regardless of the materials they attempt to frame.

---

# Shadow Language

Shadow is used sparingly and only where it earns its place — a raised card, a modal that must visually separate from the page behind it. Elevation is achieved primarily through spacing, layering, and material contrast rather than drop shadow.

When shadow does appear, it should be soft, diffuse, and low-opacity, suggesting depth rather than announcing it. A hard, dark shadow reads as budget software; a barely perceptible one reads as considered.

---

# Spacing Language

Spacing in a Luxury interface is generous by default — proportionally more whitespace than a typical commercial interface would use, because scarcity of content signals confidence rather than emptiness.

Margins and padding should feel deliberately oversized rather than efficiently minimal. Rhythm should be consistent and unhurried across every section: a Luxury page never feels compressed to fit more onto the screen.

---

# Interaction Language

Interactions should feel effortless and quiet. Hover and focus states should shift subtly — a slight change in tone, weight, or opacity — never a loud color inversion or an aggressive scale transform.

Users should never need to think about the interface itself; feedback should be immediate, understated, and reassuring rather than delightful in an attention-seeking way. The experience should remain calm, predictable, and refined at every point of contact.

---

# Component Language

Components should feel substantial and carefully engineered, as though each one was considered individually rather than pulled from a generic kit. Buttons, cards, and inputs should have weight and presence without visual noise — achieved through proportion and material quality rather than ornamentation.

Avoid unnecessary visual complexity: a Luxury component earns attention through the quality of its execution, not the number of effects applied to it.

---

# Visual Rhythm

A Luxury page should unfold slowly and deliberately, with generous pauses between moments — much like moving through a well-designed physical space rather than scrolling through a feed. Each section should feel like it was given room to be fully realized before the next one begins.

Consistency across typography, spacing, corner treatment, and restraint in border and shadow is what allows the whole page to read as a single, considered composition rather than a sequence of separately styled sections.

---

# Balance

Luxury values restraint.

Every element should feel necessary.

Removing unnecessary complexity often increases perceived quality.

The interface should never appear crowded or overly decorative.

---

# Responsive Behavior

Luxury depends on space and proportion, both of which a phone viewport is hostile to. This is the language that most requires mobile to be composed rather than adapted.

Space is the language. Compressing margins to fit more content above the fold converts a Luxury layout into an ordinary one immediately. Accept more scrolling; the composure is the product.

Photography should be recomposed rather than cropped down. A wide, atmospheric desktop image scaled to a phone loses the space that made it feel considered. Prefer taller, deliberately framed mobile crops chosen as their own compositions — this is a content decision recorded alongside the image, not a CSS one. See `.hubzero/content/principles.md` — Media Belongs to the Record.

Typographic proportion must be re-established, not scaled. Display type that felt confident at desktop scale can feel merely large on a phone; line height and letter spacing usually need adjusting rather than inheriting.

Navigation should remain understated. A full-bleed high-contrast mobile menu is the most common place a Luxury blueprint breaks character, because it is the one component built for utility rather than atmosphere.

Motion stays near-absent. If anything, mobile should have less.

---

# Token Contract

Luxury must own the following rather than inherit them.

* **Spacing scale** — substantially more generous than a neutral default, especially at the upper end. This is the language's defining value.
* **Type scale** — a wide range with a refined display end, plus explicitly tuned line height and letter spacing.
* **Colour** — a narrow palette with deliberately rare accents. An inherited general-purpose scale provides variety this language exists to refuse.
* **Radius** — minimal, precise, applied uniformly. Sharp or nearly sharp; a moderate inherited default reads as ordinary.
* **Shadow** — near-absent. This is measurably less than Premium's perceptible elevation, and one of the few token-level differences between them.
* **Motion duration and easing** — slow and unhurried where motion exists at all.

Luxury is expressed through typography, rhythm, restraint, and image treatment. It is never achieved through gold, heavy shadow, or ornament, and a blueprint reaching for those has substituted decoration for the language.

# Suitable Architectures

- Hospitality
- Real Estate
- Ecommerce
- Portfolio
- Booking

Luxury suits architectures where the offering is aspirational and the visitor is expected to take time. It is a poor fit wherever a visitor arrives with an urgent task — Government, Documentation, and Logistics all need efficiency this language deliberately declines to provide.

---

# Anti-Patterns

Avoid confusing luxury with extravagance.

Avoid excessive gold accents, decorative textures, or ornamental effects.

Avoid relying on visual clichés associated with premium branding.

Avoid using expensive-looking elements to compensate for weak design fundamentals.

Luxury should emerge naturally from quality.

---

# Relationship With Other Design Languages

Luxury shares the restraint of Minimal while expressing greater richness and refinement.

It shares the confidence of Modern while remaining quieter.

It shares the storytelling qualities of Editorial while placing greater emphasis on atmosphere and craftsmanship.

Choose Luxury when the objective is to communicate exceptional quality, exclusivity, and enduring value.

---

# Definition of Success

A successful Luxury design feels timeless.

Visitors should perceive exceptional quality without immediately identifying why.

The experience should communicate confidence through craftsmanship, refinement, and careful attention to every detail rather than through visual excess.

When executed correctly, Luxury is remembered not for individual design elements, but for the feeling it leaves behind.
